        <p>
          I'm aiming to put my skills to the test in a professional enterprise
          environment, where I can apply everything I've learned so far. My main
          goal is to soak up as much knowledge and experience as I can from
          whichever company is willing to give me a chance. üòÅ

            Developed a trolley tracking software using the Spring Boot and
            Vue.js frameworks with focus on writing SQL queries for a versatile
            filtering feature. Software objective was to make the trolley
            recording process quicker, and to allow easy monitoring of trolleys
            that haven't returned within their expected time frame. The software
            receives input data through a QR code scanner, which reads unique QR
            codes assigned to each trolley. This data is then stored locally in
            an embedded H2 database.
