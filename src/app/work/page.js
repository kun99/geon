          I&apos;m aiming to put my skills to the test in a professional
          enterprise environment, where I can apply everything I&apos;ve learned
          so far. My main goal is to soak up as much knowledge and experience as
          I can from whichever company is willing to give me a chance. üòÅ

            Developed a trolley tracking software using the Spring Boot and
            Vue.js frameworks with focus on writing SQL queries for a versatile
            filtering feature. Software objective was to make the trolley
            recording process quicker, and to allow easy monitoring of trolleys
            that haven&apos;t returned within their expected time frame. The
            software receives input data through a QR code scanner, which reads
            unique QR codes assigned to each trolley. This data is then stored
            locally in an embedded H2 database.
